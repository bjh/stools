note: the git add/commit stuff at the bottom is a bit dated, it is easier to just make the repo on github and use their example commands

A bunch of the stuff in here might be better handled by this package
https://github.com/life4/genesis
This package throws panic's instead of errors which I don't like
but it might be worth investigating still

For now this is really more of a multi-project wide cleanup.
